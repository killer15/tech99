# Express.js Project

This is an Express.js application that demonstrates how to set up a server with environment variables, handle errors, and more.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Prepare the `.env` File

Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to store your environment-specific variables. For example:

```env
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db" or your database url here
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the server by running:

```bash
npm run start
```

This command will start the Express.js server, which will listen on the port specified in the .env file (or a default port if not specified).
